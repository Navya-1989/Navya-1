#even and odd number
for an even when we divide it with 2 its remainder should be equal to 0 
so in if statement to check it we use the logic % to get the remainder and == to  equate the remainder to 0 or not if it is equal then statement below is printed as ouput else statement in else is printed as oupput

#sum of numbers from 1 to 50:
initially we assign a variable sum to collect the sum and it is taken as 0
then by using for loop we initiate the range of values starting from 1 to ending upto 50 and we add these iteration values i to the sum till the last value in the range is reached. once it reaches the end it prints the sum of numbers.
